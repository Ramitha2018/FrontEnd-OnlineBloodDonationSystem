  <h2>The Essence of Life... Blood</h2>
  <p>Blood is essential to life. Blood circulates through our body and delivers essential substances like oxygen and
    nutrients to the body’s cells. It also transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. There is
    no substitute for blood. It cannot be made or manufactured. Generous blood donors are the only source of blood for
    patients in need of a blood transfusion.</p>

  <h2>Main Components Blood</h2><br>
  <p>There are four main components human blood comprised with and they are Red blood cells, White blood cells,
    Platelets and Plasma</p>

  <h3>Red Blood Cells</h3><br>
  <p>Red blood cells represent 40%-45% of your blood volume. They are generated from your bone marrow at a rate of
    four to five billion per hour. They have a lifecycle of about 120 days in the body.</p><br>

  <h3>White Blood Cells</h3><br>
  <p>Although white blood cells (leukocytes) only account for about 1% of your blood, they are very important. White
    blood cells are essential for good health and protection against illness and disease. Like red blood cells, they
    are constantly being generated from your bone marrow. They flow through the bloodstream and attack foreign bodies,
    like viruses and bacteria. They can even leave the bloodstream to extend the fight into tissue.</p><br>

  <h3>Platelets</h3><br>
  <p>Platelets are an amazing part of your blood. Platelets are the smallest of our blood cells and literally look like
    small plates in their non-active form. Platelets control bleeding. Wherever a wound occurs, the blood vessel will
    send out a signal. Platelets receive that signal and travel to the area and transform into their “active” formation,
    growing long tentacles to make contact with the vessel and form clusters to plug the wound until it heals.</p>

  <h3>Plasma</h3><br>
  <p>Plasma is the liquid portion of your blood. Plasma is yellowish in color and is made up mostly of water, but it
    also contains proteins, sugars, hormones and salts. It transports water and nutrients to your body’s tissues.</p>
